# Learning PostgreSQL 10 - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Learning PostgreSQL 10 - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-postgresql-10-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788392013), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
PostgreSQL is one of the most popular open source databases in the world, and supports the most advanced features included in SQL standards and beyond. This book will familiarize you with the latest new features released in PostgreSQL 10, and get you up and running with building efficient PostgreSQL database solutions from scratch.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
fin = open('data/fake_weather_data.csv','r',newline='')
reader = csv.reader(fin)
for row in reader:
 myData.append(row)
```

In general, PostgreSQL server and client tools do not need exceptional hardware.
PostgreSQL can be installed on almost all modern platforms, including Linux, Windows,
and Mac. Also, in the book, when a certain library is needed, the installation instructions are
given.
You need PostgreSQL version 10; however, most of the examples can be executed on earlier
versions as well. In order to execute the sample code, scripts, and examples provided in the
book, you need to have at least a PostgreSQL client tool installed on your
machine—preferably psql—and access to a remote server running the PostgreSQL server.
In a Windows environment, the cmd.exe command prompt is not very convenient; thus, the
user might consider using Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) or another alternative, such
as PowerShell.
